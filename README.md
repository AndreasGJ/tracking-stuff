# Tracking stuff
This repo is only for tracking stuff

Here is the list of snippets:
- [GaHelper](src/GaHelper.php): This class can send google analytics request with PHP
- [Simple Tracking](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-tracking): When setting up tracking with a JS framework, then use the [Simple Tracking](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-tracking) package because with then you aren't relaying on the Tag Manager or Analytics system, but you are implementing the tracking setup as part of the system.
- [Tag Manager Validator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-manager-validator/cchofejnakigbabpcnlcglfdjhglepam?hl=da): If you need a testing tool for most analytics requests, then use this Chrome Plugin
